# ProjectEuler
C++ Project containing functions and classes to solve math problems from Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/

The idea was to create something modular base so that all I had to do was add “*.h” files for new Euler equations and the code would instantiate a new object based off a template.

It could use a little more work so that there's less of a need to update the “ProjectEuler.h” and “Main.cpp” files… 

But I mostly succeeded in what I was trying to accomplish in my learning

If you want to just download the executable... you will find it in the "Release" folder as: "ProjectEuler"

This can be run from any linux/unix shell commandline for x86
